                  Our current automation builder could have been more attractive and usable. Although the name said "Quick automations", very few things about it were quick.
                  The other designer and I performed a heuristic evaluation of things that did not work well for us and devised a game plan.
                  Unintuitive automation templates made it difficult for sales personnel to sell the feature.

                  As we planned our course to improve our automation flow builder, we were still determining how to proceed. Our typical customer base is heavily equipped with VoIP technology, using calling and text messaging as their primary communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hence, we decided to involve our research team to build a case study around what small/medium-scale businesses look for to automate.
                  We collaborated on the following research items -
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Who exactly is our user? And how do they use Nextiva?</li>
                  <li>How do Nextiva users interact with their customer base to acquire leads?</li>
                  <li>What does a sale lifecycle look like for these business owners?</li>
                  <li>How can we empower their routine tasks and increase customer satisfaction so they can bring in more business?</li>

                  UX research and marketing team came up with the following discoveries. These key findings helped the UX design and Product team plan for the next steps. UX research team worked with Nextiva Advisors (a group of individuals using the Nextiva App daily who have agreed to share product feedback).

                <ul>
                  <li>Phone calls, SMS, and email are primary communication channels.</li>
                  <li>Small/medium-scale businesses have shared email addresses and phone numbers to reach their audience.</li>
                  <li>Nextiva customers even use shared phone numbers for internal communications.</li>
                  <li>Small-scale businesses do not have a defined sales lifecycle.</li>
                  <li>Medium-scale businesses tend to use third-party CRM solutions and contact management solutions. Some audiences mentioned using tools like Notion and Google Spreadsheet to maintain a customer base.</li>
                  <li>Nextiva users do want quick ways to reach their customer base. Some examples -</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Welcome new customers and wish customers on their birthdays and anniversaries</li>
