                StepUp is a mobile applicationn, <b>focused on Jefferson University students and staff to help them maintain a healthy lifestyle by taking extra steps in a day.</b>
                <br /><br />
                While designing this product, I used <b>build - measure - learn's</b> iterative cycle. The applicationn follows <b>HOOKED framework, widely known for designing habit-forming products.</b>
                <br /><br />
                In the background I was <b>reading a widely popular book <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Hooked/dsz5AwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'Hooked - by Nir Eyal.'</a></b>

                To start the process of designing a product, <b>I interviewed 15 people - including college students and faculty.</b> And, interview findings were intriguing.

                <li>70% of the audience preferred walking over running.</li>

                <li>Average step count is - 6750, which is way below desired (12,000) step count.</li>
                <li>Very few people track their calorie intake.</li>

                <b>Through the primary research I came to a conclusion that students and faculty is not aware of healthy habits.</b> According to American Standards, a common man is supposed to take 12,000 steps per day to maintain healthy lifestyle.
                <b>Hence, I decided to take steps towards designing an experience that'd help my audience take extra steps per day.</b>

                <br /><br />
                The book inspired me to create a habit forming product by defining triggers and actions based on user's activity. Below is a story of a college student who joins the university and gets introduced to a new app StepUp.

                Using different theories introduced in the book, I decided to create a real-time reward based on number of steps taken per day. Every step taken after 12,000 counts as a reward, which can be redeemed at the University's campus store and cafeteria.

                Next step in designing a product was to define a feature list and kick off unwanted features. Not everything can be achieved in one day.

                Based on the the riskiest assumptions analysis, I decided to validate if the user is willing to run on different routes using a pretotype, using re-label method. I modified a Google Map, added couple of health stats, selected dummy routes, and asked audience if they would like to receive such stats from the Maps app they use.
                <br /><br />
                <b>This step especially helps when the product is in the early stagees. I could simply validate my assumption and change direction of the product.</b>
